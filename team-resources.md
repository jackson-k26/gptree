##  Communication and Corresponding Policy

We are using a Discord server as our primary communication tool. Members have agreed to operate with the following policy:

- Active hours are defined to be from 8am to 8pm Monday through Friday
- A message in need of response can not be left unanswered for more than 6 active hours
- A message using @ to refer to a team member by name must get a response from that member within 4 active hours
- Team members will use each channel for its designated purpose, and will create a new channel if deemed helpful
- Team members should still feel free to message and respond outside of active hours
- Team members acknowledge that quick responses are extreamely helpful for the group cause, and will make efforts to respond sooner than later, especially for time-sensitive tasks.
