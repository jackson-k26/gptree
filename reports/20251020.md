# Team Report

## i. Last week's goals
  - UI/UX (Richman and Yana)
    - Begin whiteboard process for landing page, tree page, SR learning page, create rough designs/wireframe. Basic design choices must be made such as aesthetic, color pallate, and "vibe" of the app.
  - Frontend (Richman, Yana, Brittan)
    - Define component hierarchy and page layouts.
    - Work with backend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment
  - Backend (Jackson, Jungho, Brittan)
    - Primary focus is to define Prisma Schema for key entities, and then write the .prisma schema file.
    - Write REST API endpoints so that client can start making requests to the database relevant to GPTree
    - Work with frontend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment

## ii. Progress and issues
  - UI/UX (Richman and Yana)
    - 
  - Frontend (Richman, Yana, Brittan)
    - User can now sign in on webpage and their session is maintained upon refresh and reroutes
    - User can naviate to tree page from landing page.
  - Backend (Jackson, Jungho, Brittan)
    - Prisma Schema has been defined
    - API endpoint is written that allows for user authentication, connected to Prisma db as adapter
    - `dev` environment restored
    - Unit testing set up with Jest (and test db)
    - Some issues were encountered with the mocha testing framework, as well as with parsing, so Jest and Zod were added to the project
    
## iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)
- All Rest Endpoints are defined (4 hrs)
- There is a UI skeleton for a tree on the tree page (4 hrs)
- Users can nagigate between the 3 pages (1 hr)
- There is a left panel that lets users create and view different tree entities (2 hrs)

## Agenda For Project Meeting

1. Ensure that everyone has a stable local installation of GPTree, that this process is well documented, and that all users have access to the DB
2. Discuss goals for this week, and assign specific tasks to individuals.
3. Discuss design assignment, and determine which people will be responsible for which parts
4. Discuss UI/UX features, and make sure that UI/UX team is setup on Figma or other tool to begin design process.
5. Meet with TA (Ask questions below)
6. Group work (if time)

### Questions for TA (Add here whenever needed)

1. n/a (for now)

## Richman Pham

**i. Last week’s goals**

- Restore working dev environemnt by Tuesday October 14
- Verify Prisma config and DB connectivity (approximately 1.5–2 hrs)
- Inspect server logs/stack traces; add temporary error logging to pinpoint failing route or DB call (1–2 hrs)
- Validate Node/npm versions and reinstall deps; clear cache and rebuild (0.5–1 hr)
- Definition of done: npm run dev starts without 500 errors; one test page performs a successful DB read.
- Fix root cause of the 500
  
**ii. Progress and issues**

- Progress
    - Wrote and published a weekly report for the team using the repo’s reports date format.
    - Co-designed a UI with Yana on whiteboard and iPad and collected feedback from everyone.
    - Learned that our programming stack for the frontend uses CSS and TypeScript.
    - Completed the coding guidelines for the structural design assignment due October 21, 2025.

- Issues 
    - None

**iii. Plans and goals for the next week**

- Implement the new UI design in TypeScript and CSS and get the site opening with the desired UI (4- 5 hours)
    - Deliverable: homepage and one sample page render the new layout and styles.
- Start planning and implementing the frontend with Yana (4 to 5 hrs)
    - Deliverable: component list, initial routing, and basic state flows.
- Complete and submit the design assignment due October 21, 2025 (2 to 3 hrs) 
    - Deliverable: final submission uploaded.

## Jackson Kent

**i. Last week's goals**
  - Restore working `dev` environment 

- Fix root cause of the 500 error 

- Complete the Architecture Assignment (due Tue, Oct 14 @ 11:59 pm PT)

- Connect backend to Groq API and get some responses (3-4 hrs, deadline of Mon, Oct 20th)

- Write code to properly structure and handle Groq responses (2-3 hrs, deadline of Mon, Oct 20th)

**ii. Progress and Issues**
  - Progress
    - Working `dev` environment was restored, and the 500 error resolved
    - Architechture assignment was completed
    - No progress has been made with Groq, as priorities were shifted elsewhere
    - Instead, several API routes have been set up to work with prisma, with Groq coming later
    - Set up unit testing with Jest, as well as a test database on prisma, and several tests have been written and pass
    - Added Zod to the app's packages for efficient and managable parsing of JSON objects
  - Issues
    - Attempted to use mocha as the initial testing framework, but for an unknown reason it was entirely unable to resolve the modules in `import` statements at the top of test files, hence the switch to Jest
    - There's no easy way to directly grab the types and format that prisma expects when we create things in the database, so manual types must be created in validation_schemas as Zod objects, which makes parsing them drastically easier

**iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)**
- Complete all API routes for Prisma (and test them) (5-6 hrs, deadline of Mon, Oct 27th)
- Write and test routes for Groq API and get some responses (3-4 hrs, deadline of Mon, Oct 27th)

- Write code to properly structure and handle Groq responses (2-3 hrs, deadline of Mon, Oct 27th)
