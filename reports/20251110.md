# Team Report

## i. Last week's goals
  - Proper tree display
  - Functional node creation
  - Improved look of UI
  - Beta ready for presentation
## ii. Progress and issues
  - Progress:
    - Improved how nodes are displayed, now they are properly spaced without any overlap issues
    - Improved node markdown editor to have much better markdown
    - Worked on system prompt to improve model output quality, this included adding a status field that lets the model ask for clarification
    - Editing backend routes and created helper method so that both Node and Tree use the same exact process for generating node text
    - We decided that there are no more frontend / backend roles, instead team roles are based on features.
  - Issues:
    - We need to add support for the clarify field so instead of creating a new node it edits the existing node on clarification
    - We may want to add support for OpenAI's api so that we can demo and/or test higher quality models.
    - There are still some issues where we don't get the followups or expected schema from our LLM, maybe we want to reprompt in this case.
    
## iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)
